The tracker stores stats in a MySQL database/table.

Depending on your MySQL configuration, you may need to slightly modify the commands below. Connect to your MySQL server as a privileged user (usually root).

1) Create a database (xbt)
  > CREATE DATABASE xbt
2) Add a user (xbt) with password
  > 
  > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON xbt.* TO 'xbt'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'xbt' WITH GRANT OPTION;
3) Verify these settings in /etc/xbt_tracker.conf
4) Run the included xbt_tracker.sql on your newly created database
  $ mysql -h localhost -u xbt -p xbt xbt < xbt_tracker.sql
